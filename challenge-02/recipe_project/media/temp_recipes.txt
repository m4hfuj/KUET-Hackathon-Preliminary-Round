Rice:      Long-grain basmati rice is commonly used for biryani because of its aroma and texture when cooked.  Meat or Vegetables (can vary based on the type of biryani):      Chicken Biryani: Chicken pieces (bone-in or boneless) are often marinated with yogurt and spices before cooking.     Mutton Biryani: Lamb or goat meat, typically cooked with rich spices to tenderize it.     Vegetable Biryani: A mix of vegetables like carrots, peas, potatoes, and beans.     Fish Biryani: Fish fillets or whole fish, often delicately marinated and layered with rice.  Spices:      Common spices include cumin, coriander, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, black pepper, and nutmeg.     Biryani Masala: A blend of spices like garam masala, which is essential for flavor.     Saffron: Often soaked in milk or water and added to give the biryani its signature golden color and aroma.  Aromatics:      Onions: Caramelized onions, also known as birista, are used in layering.     Garlic and Ginger: Fresh ginger and garlic paste are a common base for marinating meat or vegetables.     Tomatoes: For some biryanis, tomatoes are added to the meat or vegetable base for a tangy flavor.  Yogurt:      Yogurt is often used in the marinade to tenderize the meat and add creaminess.  Ghee or Oil:      Ghee (clarified butter) or oil is used for frying the onions, cooking the meat/vegetables, and adding flavor to the rice.  Herbs:      Fresh cilantro (coriander) and mint leaves are often added to enhance the freshness and fragrance.  Layering & Cooking:      The meat (or vegetables) is cooked separately with spices and then layered with partially cooked rice.     The biryani is then steamed together in a sealed pot (often using the dum method) to allow the flavors to meld.

Fried rice is a simple and versatile dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with vegetables, protein, and flavorful seasonings. Start by heating oil in a wok or large pan, then saut√© onions and garlic until fragrant. Add mixed vegetables and protein (like chicken, shrimp, or tofu), followed by scrambled eggs if desired. Stir in chilled rice, breaking up any clumps, and season with soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sesame oil. Adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and optional chili sauce for heat. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve as a standalone dish or with other sides. Fried rice is easily customizable, making it a great way to use up leftovers and create a quick, delicious meal.
